# {boundr}: Bounded Effects and Counterfactuals for Imperfect Experiments

*This R package is under development.*

This package is used to build and analyze structural graphical models as proposed by Pearl in "Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference" (Chapter 8). This approach allows for bounded estimation of counterfactuals by modeling the correlated background variables determining all observable variables.
